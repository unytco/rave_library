# RAVE Code Library

## Welcome to the RAVE Code Library

A RAVE is a Recorded Agreement, Verifiably Executed. It is similar to a Blockchain Smart Contract, but designed to take advantage of the Agent-Centric Holochain Application Architecture.

## RAVEs

See the [library directory](./library) for the RAVEs.

Each RAVE has its own directory in that library directory. Each RAVE should have some contextual information and a summary in comments at the top of its execution_code.rhai file.

## Documentation

- [Rules when writing a RAVE](./docs/rave_rules.md)
- [How to contribute to the RAVE Code Library](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## More Info and Where to Run Raves

RAVEs are designed to be run in a Peer-to-Peer Piecework Accounting application. Downloads and Documentation are available at https://github.com/unytco/hfvz-releases.
